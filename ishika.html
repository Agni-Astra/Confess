        Hi Ishika,
    </h3>
    <p>
        The reason I am writing this is because I want to tell you that I really ❤️❤️ love you ❤️❤️. I know that you
        already have a boyfriend, but I need to tell you that I love you more than you could ever know. I am so happy that I met you in my life. <strong>I am telling you this because I don’t want to regret never telling you, even years from now.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, I never <strong>want</strong> to disturb you, and I promise I’ll never disturb you again. 🙏
    </p>

    <p>
        I am truly sorry, but I cannot tell you who I am, because I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable about this. 😔
    </p>

    <p><strong>One last thing,</strong> the number you received this message from is not mine, so please don’t message or call my friend. 🚫📞</p>
    
    <p>If you want to talk to me and still want to know who I am, wear the same dress you wore at Ralamandal (By the way, you looked like an angel in that dress 😊😊). I will contact you afterward. 👗👼</p>

    <h4>This is not a love letter; I am just confessing my feelings. I’m sorry again if I’ve done anything wrong. 🙏</h4>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>Sorry once again, and I promise I will never disturb you. 🙏</h4>
    
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
    
    <center>If you've read this far, it means you really care about someone’s feelings. ❤️</center>
    
    <h1>Thank you 😊</h1>
